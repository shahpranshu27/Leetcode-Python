# Leetcode-Python

This repository contains the solutions to various Leetcode problems that I am solving in Python. I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), so the solutions here might not be the most optimized or efficient. As I continue to learn and improve, I will update and refine these solutions regularly.

Feel free to explore and contribute if you have any suggestions or improvements!

### Note: I will keep adding more problems and solutions as I work through different concepts in DSA, so stay tuned for updates.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Browse through the Python files for the respective Leetcode problems.

3. Run the solutions in your Python environment.


### Contributing:

If you notice any mistakes or have better solutions, feel free to create a pull request. I appreciate any feedback!
